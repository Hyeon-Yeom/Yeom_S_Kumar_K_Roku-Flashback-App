## Description
An app for everybody to rewind.

The Flashback app is part of the Roku streaming service. Subscribers can use this app to access three separate flashback categories: movies, television (tv) and music. Each of these three sections is comprised exclusively of entertainment from 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990 respectively. One of Flashback's main features is the differentiation of the user profile. Users are divided into two distinct categories: administrators (Parents) and Kids. Administrators (Parents) are able to control the content selected for the kid’s category.

We are in the process of making the app, and currently, we have come up with some amazing ideas that would give an idea, a glimpse of what the app would be like.

## Designing
1.	Software used
-	Adobe Xd
-	Photoshop
-	Illustrator

2.	Font
-	Gotham Font, which is used in Roku Website

3.	Blurry Background
-	To make users feel refresh while using this app.
-	Considered to show this app is quite smooth, and blurry background would be great to realize it.

4.	Pop-up Messages
-	Pop-up messages are used with different and various comment.

    For instance, ‘Downloaded successfully’ / ‘Sorry, failed to download’ / ‘Check your internet connect’, etc.

-	Considered the pop-up messages are effective to deliver messages well.
-	Considering designing the background of the pop-up messages blurry to match the design of the categories as well as the ‘more detailed information’ pages for movies, tv shows or music.

5.	Round boxes
-	Rounded boxes for content
-	Rounded buttons

6.	What we focused for this design is
-	Smoothly showing and closing pages.
-	Smoothly showing the messages, including error messages.
-	Making people feel comfortable visually while they are using it.
-	Following the latest trend.

7.	Referred sites or applications for designing
-	Youtube
-	Netflix
-	Pencake
-	Whatsapp
-	Iphone’s designs for screens or pop-up windows, etc.

## Developing

1.	Use

To overview the work download WAMP/MAMP/LAMP, git clone to the server directory, put the folder to the htdocs, then run it in the localhost by importing the database, here you see the work.

We would be building the app by using 

•	Html 5
•	JavaScript
•	PHP
•	SASS/CSS
•	MySQL
•	Vue.js
•	Bootstrap

2. Branches
- Planning to create basic file branch for html, css, and js, ajax branch, vue.js branch for more complicated works.

3. What we're going to focus on:
- To show the pop-up messages smoothly and to move to another page smoothly as well.
- To show the preview videos, play and stop it automatically.
- Mute/unmute option on the preview video.
- Sound effects when clicking or moving to another page.
- Trying to use vue.js for some pop-up messages and windows.

4. Audio
- Short Sound effects when the element selected like play button.

5. What we are going to try to figure out:
- How to make the remained date (like '15 days left') and the date for next paying (like 'next payment: Nov.22th.2022') update automatically.
